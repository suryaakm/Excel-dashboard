# 1. Data Cleaning
Made a new sheet called "Working Sheet" so I can always come back to the original raw data

(Just like creating a BACKUP Database on SQL)


Checked and removed duplicates
1  Remove duplicates



Find and replace some confusing data to make it clearer
2  Rename the data - to avoid confusion 2  Rename the data - DONE



Created a new column called the 'Age Brackets' column (for easier visualization and to categorize the ages)

Created Nested IF Statements on the 'Age Brackets' column
Nested IF Statements




# 2. Pivot tables
To help build our data visualizations and dashboard.





Static Data Visualizations:
I also made a few static data visualizations so that we can derive more insights from our bike data.


Purchased bikes per customer age brackets



Purchased bikes per Region





# 3. Dashboard Creation (Using a Slicer)
I compiled all of the data visualizations and used a Slicer to make it interactive/dynamic and turned it into a Dashboard.

6  Import Slicer - for all Pivot tables



FINAL OUTPUT:
Final Bike Sales Dashboard
